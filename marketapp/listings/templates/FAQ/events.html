    <h1>How to Create an Event</h1>
    <p>In order to create an event that you can invite other users to, hover over "Events"
      in the top right and click on it.  On this page, you will see all the events that you
      have created and events that you have accepted an invitation to.  In the header on this
      page, underneath "My Events", there will be a button that says "Create Event".  Clicking
      on the button will take you to the form to create an event.</p>
    <p>When creating an event, your event must have a title, context, date for when the event
      will be held and the location where the event will be held at.  When submitting the date
      for the event, it should be submitted in 'YY-MM-DD' format or 'YY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.  Once
      you have filled in all the fields for your event, click on "Create" at the bottom of the
      form to finish creating your event.</p>
