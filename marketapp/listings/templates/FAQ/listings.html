  <h1>How to Create an Offer Listing</h1>
  <p>In order to create listing that accepts offers, hover over "My Listings" in the top right
    navigation bar and in the dropdown select "Offers".  On this page, you will see all
    of your current active listings that are open to offers.  Below the navigation bar
    you'll see a button that says "Add Offer Listing".  Clicking on the button wll take
    you to the form to create a listing for offers.</p>
  <p>When creating an offer listing, you will only be able to receive offers from other
    users that consist of other items or money offers you you select the option to receive
    them.  Users can also offer a combination of items and money if the option is selected.
    If you rather auction off an item instead of receiving offers, creating an auction listing
    is allowed.  You will have to review these offers after you receive them and will have the
    option to accept or decline them.  You do not have to make a decision right away however,
    but you will need to accept an offer before the listing ends.  Once you accept an offer,
    the listing will be closed and you will need to communicate with the other user on how
    you'll be exchanging goods.  A receipt will also be made for the transaction for your
    convienence.</p>
  <h1>How to Create an Auction Listing</h1>
  <p>In order to create an listing to auction items, hover over "My Listings" in the top right
    navigation bar and in the dropdown select "Auctions".  On this page, you will see all
    of your current active listings that are accepting bids.  Below the navigation bar
    you'll see a button that says "Add Auction Listing".  Clicking on the button wll take
    you to the form to create a listing for bids.</p>
  <p>When creating an auction listing, users will be able to bid on your items up until
    the auction ends.  Once the auction ends, the user who placed the highest bid will win
    the auction.  However, you have the option to add an autobuy price to your auction.  If
    a user places a bid for this amount, they will auctomatically win and the auction will close.
    Once an auction closes and their has been at least one bid on the auction, a receipt will
    be generated for your convenience. You will then have to communicate with the winner on how
    you will exchange your items for money.  If an auction closes without any bids, you can relist
    it as well as edit any of the attributes, such as starting bid and autobuy price.  Auctions once
    created cannot be edited or deleted, so please check all the information for your auction before
    finalizing the creation.</p>

  <h1>FAQs for All Listings</h1>
  <h3 class="faq-question">How many items can be included in my listing?</h3>
  <p>You can include as many items as you want, but each item can only be included once.  If
    you have multiples of an item, be sure include it in the notes (only for offer listings) or
    create an item that shows all of them together.</p>
  <h3 class="faq-question">How long can a listing last?</h3>
  <p>A listing can be active for as short as an hour and as long as 7 days.  Once this time period
    is reached, the listing will end and will no longer appear for other users.  You can relist a
    listing after it has ended, but for auction listings you may only relist them if no bids had been
    made.  For offer listings, make sure to accept an offer if you have one you like before it ends,
    otherwise you will not be able to accept any offers once it has ended.</p>
