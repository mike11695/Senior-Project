    <h1>How to View Ratings</h1>
    <p>Ratings can be found on your profile detail page.  In order to view your
      profile, click on "Profile" in the top right navigation bar.  To view
      the ratings you have received from other users, scroll to the bottom of
      your profile and there will be a section for ratings.  You can view up
      to 10 ratings at a time and can click on a page number below the ratings

    <h1>How to Leave a Rating</h1>
    <p>In order to leave a rating for another user, you must have completed at
      least one exchange with a user, whether it be a trade or sale.  When
      you have an offer accepted or a bid you placed wins an auction, a
      rating ticket related to you and the listing will be created.  This
      also applies to the owner of the listing, but they'll receive their own
      ticket.  This ticket allows you to leave a rating for the listing on the
      user's profile.  When creating a rating, select the listing that you want
      to create the rating for.  For the rating value, you can rate the other
      user on a scale of 1 to 5 for how well they did with communicating and
      exchanging goods with you.  You can leave feedback as well, but it is
      optional.  Once you have filled in the neccessary fields, simply click on
      "Post" to post the rating to the user's profile.</p>
