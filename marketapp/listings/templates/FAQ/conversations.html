    <h1>How to Start a Conversation</h1>
    <p>To start a conversation with another user, you will need to go to the
      user's profile page.  You can access this page by clicking on their
      username on several different pages.  On the user's profile page, if the
      user is open to messages, there will be a button near the top right of the
      page that says "Message User".  Clicking on it will take you to the form
      to start a conversation.</p>
    <p>When starting a conversation, you will need to add a topic and message.
      The topic can be about anything such as asking about an item, asking if
      a user may be interested in an item and so on.  Your message should
      expand upon the topic to give the other user an idea of what you're trying
      to communicate with them.  Once you have added both fields, click on "Send"
      to finish creating the conversation.</p>
    <p>After you have created a conversation, you can find a list of your active
      conversations by clicking on "Conversations" in the navigation bar at the
      top right.  When you receive a new message or a new conversation is started
      with you by a different user, the "Conversation" button will slowly blink
      to alert you of the new message/conversation.  In your list of conversations,
      those with unread messages will be highlighted green while conversations
      with all messages read will have a plain white background.</p>
    <h1>How to Send a Message</h1>
      <p>Once a conversation has been created, you will be able to freely send
        messages within the conversation to the other user of the conversation.
        To do so, access your list of conversations by clicking on "Conversations"
        in the navigation bar in the top right, and on the resulting page, click
        on the name of the conversation you want to access.  </p>
      <p>On the new page,
        there will be a container that contains all of the messages in the
        conversation, and below the messages will be a text box where you can
        type in a new message.  After you finish typing in a message, click on
        the blue button next to the text box to send the message.  The recipient
        user will then be alerted to the new message by having the conversation
        be highlighted green in their list of conversations, and will remain so
        until the other user views the conversation.</p>
