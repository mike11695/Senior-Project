    <h1>How to Start a Conversation</h1>
    <p>To start a conversation with another user, you will need to go to the
      user's profile page.  You can access this page by clicking on their
      username on several different pages.  On the user's profile page, if the
      user is open to messages, there will be a button near the top right of the
      page that says "Message User".  Clicking on it will take you to the form
      to start a conversation.</p>
    <p>When starting a conversation, you will need to add a topic and message.
      The topic can be about anything such as asking about an item, asking if
      a user may be interested in an item and so on.  Your message should
      expand upon the topic to give the other user an idea of what you're trying
      to communicate with them.  Once you have added both fields, click on "Send"
      to finish creating the conversation.</p>
    <p>After you have created a conversation, you can find a list of your active
      conversations by clicking on "Conversations" in the navigation bar at the
      top right.  When you receive a new message or a new conversation is started
      with you by a different user, the "Conversation" button will slowly blink
      to alert you of the new message/conversation.  In your list of conversations,
      those with unread messages will be highlighted green while conversations
      with all messages read will have a plain white background.</p>
    <h1>How to Send a Message</h1>
    <p>Once a conversation has been created, you will be able to freely send
      messages within the conversation to the other user of the conversation.
      To do so, access your list of conversations by clicking on "Conversations"
      in the navigation bar in the top right, and on the resulting page, click
      on the name of the conversation you want to access.  </p>
    <p>On the new page,
      there will be a container that contains all of the messages in the
      conversation, and below the messages will be a text box where you can
      type in a new message.  After you finish typing in a message, click on
      the blue button next to the text box to send the message.  The recipient
      user will then be alerted to the new message by having the conversation
      be highlighted green in their list of conversations, and will remain so
      until the other user views the conversation.</p>
    <h1>How to Leave/Delete a Conversation</h1>
    <p>To leave a conversation that still has both of the users in it, go to
      your list of conversations by clicking on "Conversations" in the navigation
      bar in the top right.  In your list of conversations, for each conversation,
      there will be a button that says "Remove" in the top right of each container.
      Clicking on it will take you to a confirmation page asking if you are sure
      you want to remove yourself from the conversation.  If you are sure, click
      yes and you will no longer be part of the conversation and it will not
      show in your list of conversations.  The remaining user will still have
      access to the conversation but will not be able to send any messages.</p>
    <p>If you are the remianing user in a conversation, you can delete the
      conversation.   In your list of conversations, for each conversation where
      you are the only remaining user, there will be a button that says "Delete"
      in the top right of each container.  Clicking on it will take you to a
      confirmation page asking if you are sure you want to delete the conversation.
      If you are sure, click yes and the conversation will be deleted permanently.
      This cannot be undone so if you need to reference the messages of the
      conversation after deleting, it would be best to screenshot those you need.

    </h3>
    <p>There is no limit between the number of conversation between two
      specific users, but it should be noted that new conversations should only
      be made if there is a change in topic.  Also, old conversations that
      are no longer relevant should be deleted.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">How many messages can a conversation have?</h3>
    <p>There is no limit to the amount of messages for a conversation.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Is there a way to delete a conversation while both
      users are still a part of it?</h3>
    <p>No there is not.  This is to prevent the other user from not being able
      access the conversation afterwards in case they still need to reference it.
