    <h1>How to View Receipts</h1>
    <p>A receipt is made when you complete one of your listings, or an offer
      you made is accepted or a bid you placed wins an auction.  In order to
      view all of your active receipts, hover over "My Stuff" in the navigation
      bar in the top right corner and in the dropdown, select "Receipts".
      On the following page, you can see a list of all receipts, and in each
      container for each receipt, you can view information such as what items
      you offered or how much money you offered, and what items or cash amount
      you'll be receiving in return.  A button is included where you can message
      the other user to discuss how you will exchange items and anything else
      you would like to discuss.</p>
    <h1>Making a Payment</h1>
    <p>If you had included a cash amount in an offer that was accepted or had a
      winning bid in an auction, you will need to send a payment to the other user.
      In order to do so, go to your list of receipts and for each receipt that
      includes a cash offer from you, there will be a button at the bottom of
      the container that says "Send Payment".  Clicking on this button will take
      you to a form where you can select you payment type for PayPal.
      There are three options to choose from; "PayPal", "Pay Later" and
      "Debit or Credit Card".</p>
    <p>If you would like to make a payment through PayPal using your PayPal account,
      click on "PayPal".  In the following pop up box, enter your PayPal credentials
      and then proceed on.  On the next page, you can review the amount you're paying
      and select the payment option you want to use to pay; your PayPal balance, your
      credit/debit card or your bank.  Once you have reviewed all the information
      and selected your payment type, click on "Pay Now" and the transaction will
      be processed.<p>
    <p>The second option for paying a user is "Pay Later".  By using this option,
      you will not have to pay the full amount in one go, but will be able to
      make four payments towards the full amount over a six-week period.  The user
      that you are making the payment to will still receive the payment when it's
      made, but you will be able to make payments when they are scheduled
      automatically by PayPal.  Be advised that this can only be done with payment
      amounts between $30 and $600, but no fees or interest will charged as long
      as payments are made when scheduled.</p>
    <p>The last option to pay with is "Debit or Credit Card".  Use this option
      if you do not have a PayPal account to make payments with.  In the form
      that pops up, you will be asked to enter your credit or debit cards details
      and your billing address information.  The process is secured and PayPal will
      keep your information private, so you do not have to worry about other users
      having access to your details.  If you use this option, you will be asked
      to create a PayPal account by providing an e-mail address and password.
      Once you have filled out all of the fields, click on
      "Create Account and Pay Now" to finalize the payment.  You can then use
      the account you created in future purchases.</p>
    <p>Once a payment has been made, you will receive a short summary of the
      transaction which can always be viewed again by clicking on "Payment Details"
      for the receipt in your receipt list view.  The user you sent the payment
      to will also receive a notification to alert them that the payment has
      been made.</p>
    <h1>Deleting a Receipt</h1>
    <p>Once a payment has been made or no payment was included in the offer, you
      can delete a receipt.  Be advised though that once you delete a receipt, you
      will no longer be able to view the information included on it.  The other
      user will still be able to view the receipt however.  It is advised that
      you should only delete receipts once both parties have received their items
      and/or payments and are happy.<p>
