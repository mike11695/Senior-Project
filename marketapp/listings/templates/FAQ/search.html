    <h1>How to Search Listings</h1>
    <p>To search for listings that match a certain criteria, go to "All Listings"
      in the navigation bar in the top right corner, and in the drop down select
      "Search".  Clicking on this link will take you to the search page where you
      can search for listings.  There are several different paramaters you can
      use in your search, such as a name for a listing or possible words that
      are in a listing, the type of listing you want to find, the search radius
      of listings in an area, and lastly tags for images included in the items
      in the listing.  You can combine the parameters as well to narrow down your
      search for listings as well in order to get more specific listings.  Only
      active listings will appear in your search however.  You will be able to
      favorite listings that you find in your searches as well by clicking on the
      star in the top right corner of every listing.</p>
