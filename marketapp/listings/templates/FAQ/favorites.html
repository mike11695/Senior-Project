    <h1>How to Favorite a Listing</h1>
    <p>Favoriting a listing is very easy.  First, go to a page that lists all of a
      type of listing on the site (offer/auction/wishlist).  On that page, for each
      listing, there will be a star in the top right corner of the container.  By
      clicking on the star, you will be able to favorite the listing.  After clicking
      on it, the star will be filled in to show that it is a listing that you have
      favorited.  To unfavorite a listing, simply click on the star again, and the
      star will lose it's filling to show that the listing is not favorited.</p>
    <h1>How to View Your Favorites</h1>
    <p>To view all of the listings that you have favorited, hover over "All Listings"
      in the top right navigation bar and in the drop down select "Favorites".  The
      following page will display a list of all acitve listings that you have favorited.
      Inactive listings will not appear in this list unless they happen to be relisted
      again.  You can unfavorite any of the listings in the list by simply clicking
      on the star in the top right of any container and the star will lose it's
      filling to show that the listing is not favorited.</p>
