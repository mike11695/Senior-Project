  <h1>How to Create Items</h1>
  <p>In order to create an item for listings, hover over "My Stuff" in the top right
    navigation bar and in the dropdown select "Items". On this page, you'll be able
    to see all the items you have created so far. In the top right below the navigation
    bar there will be a green button that says "Add Item".  Clicking on this will take you
    the image creation form.</p>
  <p>When creating an item, there are some requirements to keep in mind.  First, an image
    must have at least one image selected in order to create the item.  If you don't have
    any images uploaded to the site yet, you'll be able to upload images through the item
    creation form.  An item must also have a name in order to create it.  Descriptions are
    optional and not needed, but can be useful for other users to know what the item is.
    After creating your item, other users will not be able to see it until you add it to a
    listing.</p>
  <h1>How to Edit/Delete Items</h1>
  <p>In your list of items that you've created, under each image for an item, there will be
    two buttons, "Edit" and "Delete".  Clicking on the Edit button will take you to the form
    to edit your item where you can change the name and description and add images to you item.
    Clicking on Delete button will take you to a confirmation page where you can confirm if
    you want to delete the item or not.  Be warned though, if you delete an item, any listing
    that contains that item will also be deleted as well.</p>
