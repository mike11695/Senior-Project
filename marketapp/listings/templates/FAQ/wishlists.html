    <h1>How to Create a Wishlist</h1>
    <p>Users have the option of creating a wishlist to organize items that they are searching for
      onto one page.  In order to create your wishlist, go to the navigation bar in the top right
      and click on "Wishlist".  If you haven't made a wishlist yet, you'll be taken to the form
      where you can make a wishlist.  You will need to give your wishlist a title and a description,
      but you are not obligated to add items to it right away.  Once you have added a title, description
      and items if you choose to add them now, click on "Create" to finish creating your wishlist.
      You'll then be taken to your wishlist's detail page, which you can then access later on by
      clicking on "Wishlist" in the navigation bar.</p>
    <p>Please note that you can only make one wishlist per user account.  All wishlist items
      you have will exist on the same wishlist.</p>
