    <h1>How to Create a Wishlist</h1>
    <p>Users have the option of creating a wishlist to organize items that they are searching for
      onto one page.  In order to create your wishlist, go to the navigation bar in the top right
      and click on "Wishlist".  If you haven't made a wishlist yet, you'll be taken to the form
      where you can make a wishlist.  You will need to give your wishlist a title and a description,
      but you are not obligated to add items to it right away.  Once you have added a title, description
      and items if you choose to add them now, click on "Create" to finish creating your wishlist.
      You'll then be taken to your wishlist's detail page, which you can then access later on by
      clicking on "Wishlist" in the navigation bar.</p>
    <p>Please note that you can only make one wishlist per user account.  All wishlist items
      you have will exist on the same wishlist.</p>
    <h1>How to Edit Your Wishlist</h1>
    <p>To edit your wishlist, click on "Wishlist" in the navigation bar in the top right to go to
      your wishlist's detail page.  On this page, under the title and description of your wishlist
      there is a button that says "Edit Wishlist".  Clicking on it will take you to the form where
      you can edit your wishlist.  Remember that your wishlist must have at least a title and a
      description, but it does not need to contain any items.  Once you are finished editing your
      wishlist, click on "Update" to save the changes made.</p>
    <p>You can also quickly remove items from your wishlist.  On your wishlist's detail page, each
      item that you have added to your wishlist will have a button that says "REMOVE".  Clicking on
      this button will result in a confirmation dialogue popping up asking if you are sure you want
      to remove the item from your wishlist.  If you are sure, click "Yes" and the item will be removed.
      If you need to add the item back at any time, you can easily do so by editing your wishlist.</p>

    <h1>FAQs for Wishlists</h1>
    <h3 class="faq-question">How many wishlists can I have?</h3>
    <p>Each user may only have one wishlist.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I delete my wishlist?</h3>
    <p>No, after creating your wishlist it will remain on the site permanently.  If you have no need
      for it, simply remove any existing wishlist items on it so that no wishes remain.</p>
