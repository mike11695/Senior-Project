    <h1>What is a Wishlist For?</h1>
    <p>Wishlists are to allow users to create a list of items that they want.
      These items could be items that you would want to buy from other users
      or items that you would want to trade for.  Users can then create listings
      to seek out these items so that users that own the items can get in contact
      with them to negotiate a trade or sale</p>
    <h1>How to Create a Wishlist</h1>
    <p>Users have the option of creating a wishlist to organize items that they are searching for
      onto one page.  In order to create your wishlist, go to the navigation bar in the top right
      and click on "Wishlist".  If you haven't made a wishlist yet, you'll be taken to the form
      where you can make a wishlist.  You will need to give your wishlist a title and a description,
      but you are not obligated to add items to it right away.  Once you have added a title, description
      and items if you choose to add them now, click on "Create" to finish creating your wishlist.
      You'll then be taken to your wishlist's detail page, which you can then access later on by
      clicking on "Wishlist" in the navigation bar.</p>
    <p>Please note that you can only make one wishlist per user account.  All wishlist items
      you have will exist on the same wishlist.</p>
    <h1>How to Edit Your Wishlist</h1>
    <p>To edit your wishlist, click on "Wishlist" in the navigation bar in the top right to go to
      your wishlist's detail page.  On this page, under the title and description of your wishlist
      there is a button that says "Edit Wishlist".  Clicking on it will take you to the form where
      you can edit your wishlist.  Remember that your wishlist must have at least a title and a
      description, but it does not need to contain any items.  Once you are finished editing your
      wishlist, click on "Update" to save the changes made.</p>
    <p>You can also quickly remove items from your wishlist.  On your wishlist's detail page, each
      item that you have added to your wishlist will have a button that says "REMOVE".  Clicking on
      this button will result in a confirmation dialogue popping up asking if you are sure you want
      to remove the item from your wishlist.  If you are sure, click "Yes" and the item will be removed.
      If you need to add the item back at any time, you can easily do so by editing your wishlist.</p>
    <h1>How to Add Unowned Items to Your Wishlist</h1>
    <p>Users have the option to add unowned items to their wishlist.  When viewing a listing on the
      site, you can see a view of all the items that are included in the listing.  If you feel that
      you want one of the items you see listed, you can easily add it to your wishlist.  Click on the
      item's image and you'll be taken to the item's detail page.  At the bottom of this page there
      will be a button that says "Add to Wishlist".  Click on the button and a pop up dialogue box
      will appear asking if you are sure you want to add the item to your wishlist.  If you are
      sure, click "Yes".  This will result in a copy of the item being created that you own and
      it will be added to your wishlist after.</p>
    <p>Users can also add items they own in the same way as above, but a copy of the item will not
      be made.</p>
    <h1>How to Create a Wishlist Listing</h1>
    <p>Once you have added items to your wishlist, you'll be able to create search listings for them.
      Other users will be able to contact you if they see they have an item you seek and negotiate a
      trade or sale with you.  In order to create a listing, hover over "My Listings" in the navigation
      bar in the top right and click on "Wishlist".  On this page, there will be a button under the page
      header that says "Create Listing".  Clicking on the button will take you to the form where you can
      create a wishlist listing using items on your wishlist.  When creating your listing, make sure to
      give it a name, when you want your listing to end and any notes that you want to add.  Your
      listing must also have at least one item to offer or a monetary amount.  You may include both
      items and money to offer however. Once you have added all the required info, click on "Create"
      to finish creating your listing.</p>
    <p>You can also quickly create a listing for an item on your wishlist by clicking on "LIST" under
      the item you want to list.  This will take you to the same form as above but have the item you
      cicked on already preselected.  However, note that even if you deselect the item you were creating
      the listing for it will still be added to your listing so make sure that you actually want to
      create a listing for the item before doing so.</p>
    <h1>How to Edit/Relist/Delete a Wishlist Listing</h1>
    <p>If you want to edit an active wishlist listing, relist an expired wishlist listing or delete
      a wishlist listing, you will need to view your list of wishlist listings.  In the navigation
      bar in the top right, hover over "My Listings" and select "Wishlist" in the dropdown.  You'll
      then be taken to your list of wishlist listings where you can see active and inactive listings.
      Each listing will have two buttons in their container, "EDIT" and "DELETE" for active listings
      and "RELIST" and "DELETE" for inactive listings.</p>
    <p>To edit an active listing, click "EDIT" in the container for the listing you want to edit.
      When editing your listing, you can change the name of the listing, what wishlist items you're
      seeking, the items and monetary amount you are offering and notes about the listing.  You will
      not be able to change the ending time for the listing until it expires however.  Once you have
      finished making the desired changes to your listing, click on "Update" to finish editing your
      listing.</p>
    <p>Relisting an expired listing is almost the same as editing an active listing, except that you
      can change the ending time for your listing.  To relist a listing, click on "RELIST" in the
      container of the listing you want to relist.  Relisting requires the same fields to be filled in
      as when creating a listing.  Once you have finished making the changes to your listing, click on
      "Relist" to finalize relisting your wishlist listing.</p>
    <p>You may delete an active or inactive wishlist listing if you choose.  Click on "DELETE" in the
      container for the listing that you want to delete.  You'll be taken to a confirmation page
      asking you to confirm if you want to delete the listing or not.  If you are sure, click "Yes"
      and the listing will be deleted.  Be warned though that once the listing is deleted, it can not
      be undone.</p>
