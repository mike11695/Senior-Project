    <h1>How to Edit Your Account</h1>
    <p>A user can edit their account by clicking on "Profile" in the navigation
      bar in the top right, and on the new page, there will be a button near
      the top right that says "Edit Account".  Clicking on this button will
      take you to the form where you can edit your account.  When editing your
      account, a PayPal email address and your first and last name are required.
      In this form, you can set whether you want users to invite you to events or
      have them message you.  Check "Open to Invites?" if you would like to receive
      invitations or leave it unchecked to not receive them.  Check "Open to
      Inquiries?" if you want users to message, leave unchecked if you do not
      want users to message you.  Once you have finished making changes, click
      on "Update" to save the changes to your account.</p>
    <p>There is also a reset password link on the form page if one needs to
      reset their password.  Click on the link where you'll then be taken to a
      new page asking for the email you used to sign up with.  Enter the email
      address and click the button to have a password reset email sent to the
      email you provided.</p>

    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I change my username and/or email?</h3>
    <p>At the moment we are not allowing users to change their usernames and
      emails themselves.  If a user does need to change them for whatever reason,
      send in a report detailing the changes you want and an admin will make
      the changes for you.</p>
