    <h1>How to Edit Your Profile</h1>
    <p>Users upon creating their account are made a profile.  You can view your
      profile at any time by clicking on "Profile" in the top right navigation
      bar.  A user's profile will initially appear empty until the user edits it.
      On your profile detail page, there will be a button near the top right
      that says "Edit Profile".  Clicking on it will take you to the edit form
      for your profile.  As of now, you can add a biography and set your
      delivery drop off address if you are willing to deliver items.  Once you
      have edited your profile to your liking, click on "Update" to save the
      changes.</p>
    <p>Please note that when you update your profile, data will be saved
      regarding your location so that the site is able to show you listings in
      or around the area you live in.  This is also done when you sign up for
      the first time.  If you ever change your location, simply go to the edit
      form for profiles and click on "Update", and your location info will be
      updated automatically.</p>

    <h3 class="faq-question">Is there a way to change my location myself?</h3>
    <p>No, there is no way to change your location by yourself.  This is to
      avoid people abusing locations and creating false listings in areas they
      don't reside in.</p>
