    <h1>How to Upload Images to Site</h1>
    <p>In order to upload an image to the site that you can use for items, hover over
      "My Stuff" in the top right navigation bar and in the dropdown select "Images".
      On this page, you'll be able to see all the images you have uploaded so far.
      In the top right below the navigation bar there will be a green button that
      says "Add Image".  Clicking on this will take you the image upload form.</p>
    <p>When uploading an image, you will need to provide at least an image and a
      name for the image in order to upload it.  Descriptions and tags for images are optional
      and not needed, but you may want to include a description as reference for yourself.
      Select the tags you want for your image and people will be able to find your items
      using these tags when thay are included in item creation.  Once an image is uploaded,
      no other users will be able to see it until you include it in an item.</p>

    <h1>FAQs for Images</h1>
    <h3 class="faq-question">What kind of images can be uploaded?</h3>
    <p>Any image that depicts an item that is appropriate for selling or trading can be uploaded.
      Images that include inappropriate/illegal items, people without items, too blurry or are
      undiscernible for what item you're claiming it to be will be deleted and possibly result
      in your account being suspended depending on the severity of the offence.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">What is the maximum size images can be?</h3>
    <p>Images must be no larger than 1250x1250 pixels in size. If your image is larger, you
        can use an image editing software such as MS Paint or Photoshop to resize it.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">What are images used for?</h3>
    <p>Images are used for creating items that you'll then be able to add to listings, auctions
      and wishlists.  You should have images uploaded before creating an item, but you'll have
      the option to create images when creating an item as well.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">How many images can I upload?</h3>
    <p>You are allowed to upload as many images as you want, but please remove images that
      you no longer use after a while.</p>
    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I reuse images for items?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can reuse images with items as long as they are relevant to the item being created.
      Images will continue to exist after an item has been deleted as well.</p>
